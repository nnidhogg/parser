`hopper` is a **lightweight C++23 library** for building **recursive-descent parsers**. It works seamlessly with the
**[`munch`](https://github.com/nnidhogg/munch)** project and provides a **token stream with lookahead**, **source
tracking**, and **error reporting**. The design focuses on **clarity**, **deterministic control flow**, and a small,
predictable API, making it easy to implement **LL(1)-style grammars** for DSLs, configuration formats, or full language
front-ends.

## **Status: Work in Progress**

This parsing library is actively developed and not yet feature-complete. The core components: **token streaming**,
**lookahead**, **source location tracking**, and **structured error reporting** are stable, but higher-level
abstractions are still evolving.

As the initial application of the library, work is underway on **`libs/cpp`**: a recursive-descent, precedence-climbing
parser for a subset of C++ **expressions, statements, and translation units**. Literals cover integers (decimal,
hexadecimal, binary), floating point, booleans, strings with escape sequences, and characters; line and block comments
are recognized and discarded as trivia. Expressions cover literals, identifiers, parenthesized
subexpressions, unary operators (`+`, `-`, `!`, `~`, prefix `++`/`--`, address-of `&`, dereference `*`), postfix
operators (calls, `.`, `->`, `[]`, `++`, `--`), the
standard left-associative binary precedence ladder (multiplicative, additive, shift, relational, equality, bitwise-and,
bitwise-xor, bitwise-or, logical-and, logical-or), and the right-associative ternary conditional and assignment
(plain `=` and the compound arithmetic/bitwise operators). Statements cover the expression statement, the empty
statement, compound `{}` blocks, `if`/`else` with the dangling `else` binding to the nearest `if`, `while`, `for`
with a declaration, expression, or empty init-statement, `do`/`while`, `return`, and declarations: a possibly
const-qualified fundamental type followed by comma-separated pointer/reference declarators with optional
initializers. Translation units parse as a sequence of function definitions, function prototypes, and variable
declarations, with parameters carrying the same type and declarator shapes plus optional defaults. A realistic source
file exercising the whole subset parses end to end in the test suite. Casts, raw strings, numeric suffixes, and digit
separators are not covered yet.

This serves as both a **reference implementation** and a **validation** of the library's design and usability.

Breaking changes may occur while the API is being refined.

## **Architecture Overview**

| Module        | Responsibility                                                                                          |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `hopper::parse` | The generic toolkit: `Token_reader` (one-token lookahead over a munch lexer, trivia skipping, newline normalization, line/column tracking) and `Parser_base` (the LL(1) primitives: `peek`, `check`, `accept`, `expect`, structured errors). |
| `hopper::cpp`   | The C++ front end built on the toolkit: a munch token set, plain-struct variant ASTs (`ast::Expr`, `ast::Stmt`, `ast::Translation_unit`), and a `Parser` with one implementation file per grammar area. |

The split mirrors the library's purpose: everything a recursive-descent parser needs regardless of language lives in
`libs/parse`, and everything specific to the C++ subset lives in `libs/cpp` as the reference consumer. A new language
front end starts from `Token_reader` and `Parser_base` and brings only its token set, its AST, and its grammar
functions.

## **Usage**

```cpp
#include <hopper/cpp/lexer.hpp>
#include <hopper/cpp/parser.hpp>

using namespace hopper::cpp;

Parser parser{build_lexer(), std::string{"int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }"}};

const auto unit{parser.parse_translation_unit()};

// unit.items holds one ast::Function; walk the variant ASTs with std::visit.
```

`Parser` also accepts a `std::filesystem::path` to parse a file, and exposes `parse_expression()` and
`parse_statement()` for smaller entry points. All three throw `std::runtime_error` with a position-bearing message on
lexical or syntax errors.

## **Building and Testing**

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/nnidhogg/hopper.git
cmake -S hopper -B hopper/build
cmake --build hopper/build -j 8
cd hopper/build && ctest --output-on-failure
```

munch is vendored as a submodule under `external/munch`; everything else (googletest) is fetched by CMake. Every
library has its own test suite, registered with CTest, and CI builds with GCC and Clang 19, enforces clang-format 19,
and reports coverage.
